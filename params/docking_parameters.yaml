# Distance in (m) below which to check abort criteria.
# distance refers to the distance between the front flat surface of the dock and base_link (same as lidar frame for transporter)
# this distance should be set at a distance where the robot is almost going into the dock.
# For the transporter, this value can be obtained by looking at the average front lidar distance.

# The distance (m) between base_link and the front flat surface of the dock which indicates that the robot has docked.
# For the transporter, this value can be obtained by looking at the average front lidar distance.
